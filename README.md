# Data_Storytelling

The aspiration of mining data and analysis of application in google play, the Googleâ€™s largest android app store, is to deliver in-depth insight of the data repository to application developer. This approach gives a brief perspective about the current market situation which would help in making appropriate decisions before creating the application and releasing it on the play store. To analyze the market, data such as description of app, Rating, price, installs, version, category, app version, and reviews are collected from app history and stored in a clean structure to further analyze each application. This logical study mainly focuses in measuring pair wise correlation between features thereby clustering the data set into groups. The significant level of pair-wise correlation is identified between certain features from dataset. The cluster analysis is done based on the recommendation system and statistical modeling method.
